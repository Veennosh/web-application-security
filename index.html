                   <h2>VEENNOSH NEDUNCHEZHIAN</h2>
                   <p>Hello my name is Veennosh Nedunchezhian and I’m a Web Application Security student. Currently I’m taking Bachelors of Information Technology (Hons) in Unitar International University. Talking about my skills, I have knowledge in basic programming languages such as in HTML, Java, CSS and JavaScript. The main purpose of my portfolio is to give awareness regarding Web Application Security to end users and the importance of Web Application Security in the internet world. I gained enough exposure in building my own personal website and it was a good exposure for me in web designing. By creating my personal website, I was able to solve the errors that I received through out the process and design my website according to my creativity. It was very helpful for me to think critically and creatively.</p>

      <h1 class="headings">Malware</h1>
      <p>Malware is a software that is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system. There are few types of malwares such as Adware, Bots, Ransomware, Rootkits, Spyware, Trojan horse, Virus and Worms. Each types of malwares has its own characteristic and acts different in the internet world. Below you can view a mind map for types of malwares and its threats. I would start with adware, there is two types of softwares which is gator which tracks user’s browsing habits while Fireball take control of victim’s browser. Bot uses distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) to disrupt network traffic of server. Ransomware users malicious softwares such as Lockers and Scareware to lock user’s file until it was paid and manipulate users into buying unwanted products. While rootkits attacks through memory and hardware with infecting hard drives and computer hardwares and affects computer’s Random Access Memory (RAM). Spyware uses Keylogger to copy user’s keystrokes that user enters. Next, Trojan Horse sends Backdoor to infects user’s system and Banker to obtain confidentials. Data in a computer system is in threat if virus enters the system which is called “file infector” and it can replicate across computers through network with network virus. Last but not least, worm is one of the most dangerous malware because it can self-replicates and distributes copies of itself to its network. These independent virtual viruses spread through the Internet, break into computers, and replicate without intervention from and unbeknownst to computer users.</p>

                  <h1 class="headings">Web apps security architecture</h1>
                  <p>The web application architecture describes the interactions between applications, databases, and middleware systems on the web. It ensures that multiple applications work simultaneously. Let us understand it with a simple example of opening a webpage.</p><br>
                  <p>Single-tier web application architecture</p>
                  <p>The application’s web server and database server share the same host machine. This architecture is very simple and useful for early stages of project development. However, it is not good enough for production applications as it introduces a single point of failure.</p><br>
                  <p>Two-tier web application architecture</p>
                  <p>You can separate the database server from the web server. However, both servers remain single points of failure within the architecture. If one server crashes, the application can stop.</p><br>
                  <p>Multi-tier (N-tier) architecture</p>
                  <p>Multi-tier architecture separates different components of the application into multiple tiers/layers according to their functions. Each tier generally runs on a different system. This provides compartmentalization and avoids a single point of failure.</p><br>

               <h1 class="headings">Propose user awareness of web application security threats</h1>
               <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security, cyber security measures are designed to combat threats against network systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization.</p><br>
               <p>To bring awareness to the public users every company should arrange a cyber security specialist to give a talk on the importance of web application security. It would be so helpful to the public to have knowledge in this internet world.</p><br>
               <p>The National Cyber Security Agency (NACSA) should post more about web application security on their blogs, websites and social media so it would be in attention to the public. By doing this, the information would spread fast in internet and will comes to the attention of public.</p><br>

               <h1 class="headings">Implementation of web apps security examples</h1>
               <p>1. Perform a risk assessment.</p>
               <p>The identification of security needs is vital when creating effective protocols. At this stage, you must take into account and evaluate that those factors most likely to impact the security of web applications. For example; the level of sensitivity of the data handled in the application, accessibility; traceability, legal obligations, type of users that will have access, etc. After the identification process, it is advisable to prioritize the factors of greatest impact in order to proceed to establish the most appropriate strategies.</p><br>
               <p>2. Establish strategies against harmful user input.</p>
               <p>Assuming that user entries are secure is a mistake as it prevents the necessary precautions from being taken, and in this way, malicious users can easily send harmful information to your application.</p><br>
               <p>3. Protect sensitive data</p>
               <p>Implementing SSL encryption is a vital strategy when protecting applications that handle sensitive data. Another way to protect information is to configure your web server to automatically redirect all HTTP requests to encrypted pages. This will prevent passwords or session IDs from being transmitted clearly.</p><br>
               <p>4. Develop a secure password reset system</p>
               <p>Normally password reset systems are based on personal questions; if this is the case with your web application, it is best to set up a system in which the questions are difficult to guess. When creating this system, make sure that the reset option does not reveal whether an account is valid or not, in order to avoid the enumeration of usernames.</p>

            <h2>Article Review</h2><br>
            <h1>WHAT ARE THE LATEST CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS?</h1><br>
            <p>Cybersecurity standards are agreed-upon procedures and practises that organisations adopt to reduce the risk of cyberattacks and deal with their effects. Most cybersecurity protocols, which may be applied to networks, apps, services, and even people, focus on prevention through different tools, rules, best practises, and technology. Although most organisations should adopt a voluntary framework even if they are not required to do so, these standards are frequently created to meet with specific industry laws. Cybersecurity standards make it easier for organisations to safeguard their data and standardise security methods, making it harder for fraudsters to prosper. Because there may be various legislation or concerns to be mindful of, these standards are frequently modified for individual nations or sectors. Companies in a variety of sectors are beginning to take cybersecurity extremely seriously as a result of the potential harm that it might do. All firms should have a cybersecurity framework in place to assist lower the risk of an attack, as well as contingency plans in place so that employees know what to do in the event of an attack.</p><br>
            
            <h1>HOW RANSOMWARE AUTHORS HIT HEALTHCARE SECTOR?</h1><br>
            <p>One of the most revolting cybercrime trends of 2020 is the growth in phishing efforts based on the coronavirus scare. Rogue emails are impersonating reputable medical organisations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), tricking consumers into divulging account credentials and installing banking Trojans. While these scams do not specifically target the healthcare industry, ransomware affects hospitals' computer networks in targeted attacks. The International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) has issued a warning to hospitals about an upsurge in ransomware attacks. Officials stress that the consequences of such an assault are not limited to data loss. It hampers rapid medical action and, as a result, may have major real-world consequences, placing a large number of people at risk.</p><br>

            <h1>What difficulties did you face with the research process? What major lessons did you learn about the research process? How did you meet the challenges?</h1><br>
            <p>While working on this portfolio I faced a lot of problems, the main problem was me coding the website. It took a lot of time to code each by each line and I was notified with plenty of errors yet I still managed to complete my portfolio successfully. Besides that, I had difficulties to insert each and every images in my website and it takes so much time. 
               Major lessons that I learnt from this research process is it enhanced my knowledge in programming languages in HTML and CSS. I also gained more knowledge regarding on web application security such as web apps security architecture, web application security threats and implementation of web apps security. I referred course notes and browsed internet to gain more information on creating my portfolio and more details about web application security. The major lessons that I learnt was I have to be patient and focused through out the research process in order to complete my portfolio.</p><br>

           <h1>When working with outside evidence, what kinds of steps do you take to prevent plagiarism?</h1><br>
           <p>I will plan my paper well is the first and most important step that I can take toward preventing plagiarism. This means working out a balance between the ideas I have taken from other sources and my own, original ideas. Writing an outline or coming up with a thesis statement in which you clearly formulate an argument about the information I find will help establish the boundaries between my ideas and those of my sources. Besides that, I would analyze and evaluate my cources such as where they got their information, and when they wrote it this information is also an important step in avoiding plagiarism. Next, i would avoid sharing my research informations in any platforms which it might be plagiarized. It is very important to save our research informations in a proper and secured platforms.</p><br>
